# Campus Cluster Installation

We put our images into `/projects/cs/cs484/images` .
A symlink lives there named `cs484_student.img` which points to the current image.

All of the `.sh` files assume that the container image
    `/projects/cs/cs484/images/cs484_student.img` exists.
Put the '.sh' files in `/projecs/cs/cs484/` .
    (A `bin` subdirectory would eventually be advisable,
        but all the MPs would have to change.)
