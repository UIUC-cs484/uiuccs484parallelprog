# Building Singularity container

Currently, you have to build the singularity containers manually on the commandline.
Perhaps the new version of Singularity no longer needs you to have root access to build, but previously it did.
I always used the VMFarm machine as the place to build singularity containers.
Hopefully you won't have to at all.


##authentication to dockerhub

somehow, building from the commandline from docker directly doesn't work
(authentication error)

but using a Singularity file to build, and basing on the dockerhub repo, works
fine.
